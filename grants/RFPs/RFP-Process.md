# Request for Proposals (RFPs) from the Exploration Team

We are focusing on RFP grants where the Avail Team provides funding for specific development work. These RFP grants offer a unique opportunity for teams to receive funding for their contributions to projects that align with the Avail mission. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP.

In these grants, we generally have areas of interest and focus points, that align with the Explorations Teams efforts. Some RFPs may ask contributors to propose their own milestones and funding needs, but they should still align with the project's goals. To ensure the proper use of funds, it is imperative that teams adhere to the scope outlined in the RFP. Funds will only be distributed on a milestone basis.

## What does the Grant process look like? âœ¨
  - Check out the existing and open RFPs that you may want to work on.
  - Submit your proposal via the [submission form.](https://airtable.com/app3uGEo7mZ5jbIfW/shrMMQEmNgmcMyuHJ)
  - An Avail team member will get back to you regarding your proposal status. There may be additional rounds of discussions before a verdict is reached.
  - If your proposal is accepted, ensure to update your progress as you reach your milestones as defined in your proposal [via this form.](https://airtable.com/app3uGEo7mZ5jbIfW/shrqDl4UIcpnEKmTH).


## Milestone based Funding & Reporting ðŸ’«

An RFP may be open-ended and require you to specify your milestones and funding requirements for each milestone. During your application process you will need to submit a spreadsheet file with information regarding the same. You may use the following template to specify the milestones in your **_application/proposal_**.

| Milestone No. | Milestone Summary & Staffing | Funding | Estimated Timeframe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Example milestone | $X | Y weeks |
| 2 | Example milestone | $X | Y weeks |
| 3 | Example milestone | $X | Y weeks |

Once your proposal is accepted and you are given the go-ahead to implement your proposal, you will need to update your progress on your project via timely Milestone Reporting. During the milestone reporting process, you will need to submit a spreadsheet file with information regarding the same. You may use the following template to specify the milestones in your **_Milestone Report_**.

| Milestone No. | Milestone Type | Milestone | Criterion/Deliverable | Proof (Source of Truth) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1 | Critical |  |  |  |  |
| #2 | Soft |  |  |  |  |


  _Note:_  
  - _Critical milestones are milestones that are critical to the success of the project and act as the definitive proof of progress in the implementation of the project. They represent key deliverables or phases that must be completed on time to ensure the project stays on track and meets its objectives. Failure to meet critical milestones can lead to significant delays or even project failure._
  - _Soft milestones, on the other hand, are important but not as critical as critical milestones. They may represent goals, achievements, or deliverables that are desirable to achieve within the project but may have some flexibility in terms of timing. Missing a soft milestone may not have as severe consequences as missing a critical milestone.  They can provide insights into the project's performance in terms of quality, scope, or specific goals._
