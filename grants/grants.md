### (Coming Soon!)
# Grants Program üí∞


## Overview üê±‚Äçüë§

Our grants program aims to **SCALE AVAIL‚ÄôS ECOSYSTEM BY SUPPORTING** developers who are working on innovative projects that align with our mission.  We will offer funding to help these developers bring their ideas to life and positively impact their communities. Our initial focus will be on RFPs where we fund teams, collaborators, and developers for building tools based on the specific ecosystem projects needed by the Avail Exploration Team. 

We will also be focusing on individual and team contributors who help contribute via PRs directly to any of the current Uncharted projects the team is working on, via small micro-grants via OnlyDust. More information on this later.

We will eventually broaden our scope to a more generalized grants program to incentivize projects, and position Avail in the mind of developers as a secure and optimal base layer they can utilize. This grants program will be running in parallel with the Exploration Team‚Äôs operations and needs.


## Scope ü§ì

Our primary focus is strengthening Avail's foundations and enabling future builders. This involves improving infrastructure, expanding the range of tools available to those building on Avail, deepening our understanding of cryptographic primitives, and growing the builder ecosystem through education and community development. The work we support is free, open-source, non-commercial, and built for positive-sum outcomes.


## Program Categories üöÄ

- **Request for Proposals (RFPs) from the Exploration Team -** We are focusing on RFP grants where the Avail Team provides funding for specific development work. These RFP grants offer a unique opportunity for teams to receive funding for their contributions to projects that align with the Avail mission. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP.
    
    In these grants, we generally have areas of interest and focus points, that align with the Explorations Teams efforts. Some RFPs may ask contributors to propose their own milestones and funding needs, but they should still align with the project's goals. To ensure the proper use of funds, it is imperative that teams adhere to the scope outlined in the RFP. Funds will only be distributed on a milestone basis.
  Learn more about the RFP process here.
  
- **Open Source Contributor Grants -** In addition to external ecosystem building projects, we also want to encourage developers to contribute to any of our [existing Avail Uncharted projects](https://github.com/availproject/avail-uncharted#%EF%B8%8F-active-projects-%EF%B8%8F). Via an integration with OnlyDust we will be rewarding developers who help contribute to our projects through eligible PRs.
  Interested in contributing to any of the Uncharted projects but not sure how to start? Join our Avail Uncharted Developer Community to get onboarded to a project you want to help with.
