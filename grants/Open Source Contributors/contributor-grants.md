# Open Source Contributor Grants ðŸ’»

In addition to RFP grants that aim to encourage teams to build ecosystem adapters and tools that would enrich the Avail ecosystem, we also want to encourage developers to contribute to any of our [existing Avail Uncharted projects.](https://github.com/availproject/avail-uncharted/tree/main#%EF%B8%8F-active-projects-%EF%B8%8F) The core idea here is for you, as a developer and contributor to our existing projects, to get rewarded for your efforts. 

The Contributor Grants program will be ongoing and run parallel with the RFP program, and this grant category will be distributed via integration with [OnlyDust](https://www.onlydust.xyz/) to reward developers who help contribute to our projects through eligible PRs.

## Eligibility ðŸ’«
Be a contributor to any of Avail's existing Uncharted explorations projects, take ownership of Issues, and create PRs for these projects. Anyone who makes meaningful contributions to our repositories is eligible. 

## Grant Process âœ¨
- Go through the list of [active Avail Uncharted projects](https://github.com/availproject/avail-uncharted/tree/main#%EF%B8%8F-active-projects-%EF%B8%8F).
- Join the [Avail Uncharted Community group](https://t.me/avail_uncharted) to discuss with project leads and to get onboarded easily.
- Start contributing to the projects, by creating PRs.
- Eligible PR (Pull Request) contributors will be contacted to receive their grant.
- Grantees will be asked to sign up on OnlyDust to receive their grant.
